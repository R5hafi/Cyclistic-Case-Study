Cleaning Documentation:

- Latitude and longitude data were converted to the double data type with 4 decimal places to avoid errors in type conversions during exporting for each spreadsheet.
- Ride_id was converted to text data types, so that there isn't any automatic interpretation of other data types.
- Certain calculated ride times were negative because listed start and end times had errors, for example 5:34:21 pm as the start and 5:34:09 as the end. Assumed this was a data entry error thus times were swapped in the spreadsheets using IF Statement functions in Excel.
- Ride_length was converted to text because MS Access was misinterpreting time formats in HH:MM:SS as dates.
- start/end_station_id was removed for redundancy because the longitude and latitude columns were the only ones needed to find distance.
- Rows, where member status (member_casual) was blank, were not included in the analysis due to no relevancy.
- Many rows had bike rides which had the same start and end location, or blank lat and lng values, these cells were not included in the study.
